# Solitaire---Parker-Lanum
4/18/2025

Not code I'm particularly proud of, but I am confident with the finished product considering how uncomfortable I felt in lua leading up to this assignment. If I had more time, I DEFINITELY would have added functionality to each card to allow them to communicate with each other (have cards store if they are the topmost card, whether they start a chain of cards, etc.), I would have actually made a new file for a tableu structure that could track the cards within it and help with some of the processes I mentioned earlier. Another great feature would be to add a sort of "locking" that corrects the player's cards into the nearest available spot and, of course, it would have been nice to prevent the player from putting cards where they cannot go.

 My solution to the hidden cards problem (since I did not end up allowing cards to store whether or not they were exposed) was to simply allow the player to flip them over themselves with a right click. This is not an elegant solution by any means but it along with being able to put cards anywhere almost brought back the charm of paper solitaire where you can handle the cards as robustly as you like (and cheat when you get bad luck).

All of the sprites were made by myself using the online tool, Piskel.
